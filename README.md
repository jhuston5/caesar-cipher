# LAB - 18

## Caesar Cipher

Functions:

- encrypt: encrypts a phrase with a Caesarian cypher using a given key
- decrypt: decrypts phrase with given key
- crack: brute force decryption without using key
- work_check: uses nltk to check words in the crack function to parse through nonsense phrases

### Reflections and Comments

This was a good lab, lots of challenging features but overall manageable with some pointers in the right direction. I decided to come up with a separate function to assist the crack function in checking words against nltk. My solution used ASCII values for encryption.
